# Admin Site Merge Progress Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the progress made on merging the `vosf-old-site` admin functionality into the `vostudiofinder` application. The goal was to integrate the admin site so that its root becomes the `/admin` page of `vostudiofinder` (e.g., `https://vosf-old-data.mpdee.co.uk/dashboard` becomes `https://vostudiofinder.mpdee.co.uk/admin/dashboard`).

- Added missing admin models (Faq, Contact, Poi)
- Standardized camelCase field naming with `@map()` for database columns
- Preserved data relationships and constraints

### Authentication
- Consolidated to `vostudiofinder`'s NextAuth.js system
- Extended JWT and session to include admin role
- Implemented RBAC with ADMIN role
- Admin users redirect to `/admin/dashboard` after login

### Styling and UI
- Applied vostudiofinder's Raleway font and color scheme
- Used Tailwind CSS with custom color palette
- Implemented responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Created shared component library for consistency

### Security
- All admin routes protected by server-side and client-side guards
- SQL query interface restricted to SELECT statements only
- Proper authentication middleware on all admin API endpoints
- Role-based access control throughout
