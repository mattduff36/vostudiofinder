"1","NEEDS UPDATING","src/app/help/page.tsx","146","Simple annual membership: One flat fee per year for unlimited listings.","Simple membership: List your studio for free, or go Premium for just £25/year to unlock all features.","High","Implies all users pay. Also 'unlimited listings' is wrong — each user gets one listing. Should reflect Basic (free) + Premium (paid)."
"2","NEEDS UPDATING","src/components/auth/SignupProgressIndicator.tsx","13","{ id: 'payment', label: 'Payment', number: 3 }","Change label to 'Membership' (or 'Plan')","High","Basic users don't pay, so 'Payment' is misleading for step 3. 'Membership' covers both tiers."
"3","NEEDS UPDATING","src/components/auth/ResumeSignupBanner.tsx","27","payment: 'Complete your Premium membership payment (£25/year)'","Change to: 'Choose your membership plan'","High","When resuming at the membership step, user hasn't chosen a tier yet. This text wrongly assumes Premium."
"4","NEEDS UPDATING","src/components/dashboard/ProfileEditForm.tsx","1200-1201","Basic members can add up to {X} social links. Upgrade to Premium for unlimited.","Change 'for unlimited' to 'to enable them all'","Medium","Premium gives all 8 social fields, not truly 'unlimited'. Tooltip at line 1233 was already corrected to 'to enable them all'. This banner should match."
"5","NEEDS UPDATING","src/components/dashboard/ProfileEditForm.tsx","910","Basic members can select up to {X} studio type. Upgrade to Premium for unlimited.","Change 'for unlimited' to 'for all studio types'","Medium","There is a finite set of studio types. 'Unlimited' is misleading."
"6","NEEDS UPDATING","src/components/dashboard/ProfileEditForm.tsx","1293","Basic members can select up to {X} connections. Upgrade to Premium for unlimited.","Change 'for unlimited' to 'for all connection types'","Medium","Premium gives all 12 standard + 2 custom connections, not truly 'unlimited'."
"7","NEEDS UPDATING","src/components/membership/MembershipPaywall.tsx","14-16","title = 'Membership Required', message = 'You need an active membership to perform this action.', action = 'Renew Membership'","Change to: title = 'Premium Membership Required', message = 'This feature requires an active Premium membership.', action = 'Upgrade to Premium'","High","This gates Premium features, but Basic users DO have a membership. Current wording would confuse Basic members into thinking they have no membership at all."
"8","NEEDS UPDATING","src/app/terms/page.tsx","172-174","If we introduce paid options (such as annual subscriptions or featured listings):","Change to present tense: 'We offer the following paid options:' or 'Our paid features include:'","Medium","Paid options already exist (Premium £25/year, Featured Studio). 'If we introduce' is outdated."
"9","NEEDS UPDATING","src/components/billing/EnhancedCheckout.tsx","104-123","Feature list: Featured studio listing / Priority placement in search results / Unlimited photo uploads / Enhanced profile customisation / Detailed analytics and insights","Align with actual Premium features: Up to 5 studio images / All studio types including Voiceover / All connections + custom methods / Phone & directions visibility / Custom SEO meta title / Verified & Featured eligibility","High","Multiple features listed are wrong: 'Featured studio listing' is a separate add-on; 'Unlimited photo uploads' should be 'Up to 5'; 'Priority placement' and 'Detailed analytics' may not be implemented."
"10","NEEDS UPDATING","src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx","398","Start your membership to showcase your studio to voice artists worldwide","Change to: 'Sign up to showcase your studio to voice artists worldwide' or 'Create your free account to showcase your studio to voice artists worldwide'","Low","'Start your membership' subtly implies a paid commitment. Softening to 'Sign up' or 'Create your free account' is more welcoming for Basic users."
"11","FOR REVIEW","src/lib/email/templates/payment-success.ts","39","We've successfully processed your payment. Your membership is now active.","Consider: 'We've successfully processed your payment. Your Premium membership is now active.'","Low","Only sent to Premium payers so technically correct, but adding 'Premium' makes it clearer in the two-tier context."
"12","FOR REVIEW","src/lib/email/template-registry.ts","111","We've successfully processed your payment. Your membership is now active.","Consider adding 'Premium' — 'Your Premium membership is now active.'","Low","Same as #11 but in the template registry version."
"13","FOR REVIEW","src/app/admin/emails/template/[key]/test/page.tsx + preview/page.tsx","38-42","planName: '1 Year Membership'","Consider: '1 Year Premium Membership'","Low","Test/preview data for emails. Updating to '1 Year Premium Membership' adds clarity."
"14","FOR REVIEW","src/lib/email/templates/legacy-user-announcement.ts","62, 102","six months of free membership","Consider: 'six months of free Premium membership'","Medium","'Free membership' is ambiguous now that Basic IS the free tier. Legacy users get 6 months of Premium for free. Only relevant if this email is still being sent."
"15","FOR REVIEW","src/app/api/user/profile/route.ts","969","Some fields were not saved because your plan limit was reached. Upgrade to Premium for unlimited access.","Consider: 'Some fields were not saved because your Basic tier limit was reached. Upgrade to Premium to unlock all features.'","Medium","'Plan limit' is vague. 'Unlimited access' isn't accurate — Premium has higher limits, not truly unlimited."
"16","FOR REVIEW","src/app/[username]/not-found.tsx","57-59","Want to list your studio? Join the waitlist","Consider changing link to /auth/signup if platform is live and accepting signups","Low","Links to /join-waitlist rather than /auth/signup. Not a tier issue per se, but may be outdated if signups are open."
"17","FOR REVIEW","src/components/billing/EnhancedCheckout.tsx","92","Annual subscription","Consider: 'Annual membership'","Low","Premium is a one-time annual payment, not a recurring subscription. 'Membership' is more accurate."
