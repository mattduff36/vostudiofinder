## Notes

### Technical Decisions Made

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router for optimal performance and SEO
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM for type safety and migrations
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js for secure, extensible auth system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first responsive design
- **API**: tRPC for end-to-end type safety between client and server
- **Hosting**: Vercel for frontend, Railway/Render for database
- **Payment**: Stripe for secure payment processing and subscription management
- **Maps**: Google Maps JavaScript API for location services
- **Image Storage**: AWS S3 or Cloudinary for optimized image handling
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking, Vercel Analytics for performance

### Key Constraints

- **Timeline**: 20 weeks (5 months) total development time
- **Budget**: Optimize for cost-effective hosting and third-party services
- **Performance**: All pages must load in <2 seconds on 3G connections
- **Compatibility**: Support last 2 versions of major browsers
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
- **Security**: PCI DSS compliance for payment processing

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

- **Data Migration**: Multiple test migrations before production
- **Performance**: Comprehensive load testing and optimization
- **Security**: Regular security audits and penetration testing
- **User Adoption**: Maintain identical UI/UX to minimize resistance
- **SEO Impact**: Proper 301 redirects and URL structure preservation

### Success Metrics Targets

- **Performance**: Lighthouse score >90, Core Web Vitals in "Good" range
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability target
- **User Growth**: 30% increase in new registrations within 6 months
- **Revenue**: 35% increase in annual recurring revenue
- **Conversion**: 15% premium conversion rate for studio owners
