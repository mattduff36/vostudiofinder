Product Requirements Document (PRD): Home Page and Studios Search PageIntroduction/OverviewThis PRD defines the requirements for creating a comprehensive voiceover studio finder platform with two core pages: a Home page that introduces users to the platform and showcases featured studios, and a Studios page that provides advanced search and filtering capabilities for finding recording studios worldwide.

studios that meet their specific needs (location, equipment, services), while studio owners lack an effective platform to showcase their facilities to potential clients.Goal: Create an intuitive,
