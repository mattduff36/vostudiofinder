**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 19, 2024  
**Author:** Development Team  
**Status:** Draft  

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the critical changes required to implement a paid membership model for VoiceoverStudioFinder, transforming from a free registration platform to a public browsing platform with paid account creation.

## Problem Statement

### Current State Issues

### Business Impact
- **Revenue Model Misalignment**: Free registration doesn't support business sustainability
- **User Experience Confusion**: Users expect free access but encounter signup walls
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Competitors may offer better public browsing experiences
