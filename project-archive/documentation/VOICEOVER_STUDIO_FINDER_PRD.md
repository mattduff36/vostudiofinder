// Studio management
const studioRouter = router({
  // Get all studios with filtering
  getStudios: publicProcedure
    .input(
      z.object({
        location: z.string().optional(),
        radius: z.number().optional(),
        studioType: z.string().optional(),
        services: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
        page: z.number().default(1),
        limit: z.number().default(20),
      })
    )
    .query(async ({ input }) => {
      // Implementation with filtering and pagination
    }),

  // Create studio profile
  createStudio: protectedProcedure
    .input(studioSchema)
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      // Create studio with user ownership
    }),

  // Update studio profile
  updateStudio: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({ id: z.string(), data: studioSchema.partial() }))
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      // Update studio with ownership validation
    }),
});

// Authentication endpoints
const authRouter = router({
  // Get current user session
  getSession: publicProcedure.query(({ ctx }) => ctx.session),

  // Update user profile
  updateProfile: protectedProcedure
    .input(userProfileSchema)
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      // Update user profile
    }),
});
```

interface MigrationScript {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  dependencies: string[];
  up: () => Promise<void>;
  down: () => Promise<void>;
  validate: () => Promise<boolean>;
}

const userMigration: MigrationScript = {
  name: 'migrate_users',
  version: '001',
  dependencies: [],

  async up() {
    // Read from old MySQL database
    const oldUsers = await oldDb.query('SELECT * FROM users');

    // Transform and validate data
    const transformedUsers = oldUsers.map(transformUser);

    // Insert into new PostgreSQL database
    await newDb.user.createMany({ data: transformedUsers });
  },

  async down() {
    // Rollback logic
    await newDb.user.deleteMany({});
  },

  async validate() {
    // Verify migration success
    const oldCount = await oldDb.query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users');
    const newCount = await newDb.user.count();
    return oldCount === newCount;
  },
};
```
