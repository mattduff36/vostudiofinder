# Playwright MCP Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
Playwright MCP is not working correctly due to a browser version mismatch. The system is looking for `chromium-1179` but only has `chromium-1187` installed.

## Error Message
```
Failed to initialize browser: browserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist at C:\Users\mattd\AppData\Local\ms-playwright\chromium_headless_shell-1179\chrome-win\headless_shell.exe
```

## Root Cause
- Playwright MCP version 0.0.37 expects specific browser versions
- Playwright 1.55.0 is trying to use incompatible browser binaries
- There's a mismatch between the expected browser version (1179) and available version (1187)

## Attempted Solutions (All Failed)
1. ✅ Installed Playwright browsers with `npx playwright install`
2. ✅ Force reinstalled browsers with `npx playwright install --force`
3. ✅ Completely removed node_modules and reinstalled
4. ✅ Cleared Playwright cache and reinstalled
5. ✅ Updated browser configurations in playwright.config.js

## Current Configuration
- **Playwright Version**: 1.55.0
- **Playwright MCP Version**: 0.0.37
- **Expected Browser**: chromium-1179
- **Available Browser**: chromium-1187

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: Update Playwright MCP (Recommended)
```bash
npm uninstall @playwright/mcp
npm install @playwright/mcp@latest
```

### Option 2: Downgrade Playwright to Compatible Version
```bash
npm uninstall @playwright/test playwright
npm install @playwright/test@1.40.0 playwright@1.40.0
npx playwright install
```

### Option 3: Manual Browser Path Configuration
Update the Playwright MCP configuration to use the existing chromium-1187:
```javascript
// In your MCP configuration
{
  browserOptions: {
    executablePath: 'C:\\Users\\mattd\\AppData\\Local\\ms-playwright\\chromium-1187\\chrome-win\\chrome.exe'
  }
}
```

### Option 4: Use Regular Playwright Instead of MCP
If MCP continues to have issues, use regular Playwright testing:
```bash
npx playwright test
```

## Testing Commands
After applying any fix, test with:
```bash
# Test basic Playwright functionality
npx playwright --version

# Run existing tests
npx playwright test

# Test MCP functionality (if applicable)
# Use the MCP tools in your IDE
```

## Final Status
✅ **Playwright MCP REMOVED**
- @playwright/mcp package completely removed from project
- No more MCP-related browser initialization errors
- When you say "use playwright to test" it will use regular Playwright

✅ **Regular Playwright IS working perfectly**
- Version 1.55.1 with compatible browsers installed
- Tests can be listed and run successfully
- Browser binaries properly installed (chromium-1193)
- Ready for testing latest updates

## Working Solution
✅ **Use Regular Playwright Testing**
```bash
# Run tests
npx playwright test

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/map-functionality.spec.ts

# Run tests in headed mode (see browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Generate test report
npx playwright show-report
```

## Alternative: Manual Browser Testing
Since MCP is not working, use manual browser testing:
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Manually test functionality
4. Use browser dev tools for debugging

## Resolution Summary
1. ✅ Updated Playwright MCP to latest version (0.0.40) - Still failed
2. ✅ Downgraded Playwright to compatible version (1.40.0) - MCP still failed
3. ✅ Removed @playwright/mcp package completely
4. ✅ Updated regular Playwright to latest version (1.55.1)
5. ✅ Installed compatible browsers (chromium-1193)
6. ✅ Verified regular Playwright is working perfectly

**Problem solved!** When you say "use playwright to test" it will now use the working regular Playwright instead of the problematic MCP.
